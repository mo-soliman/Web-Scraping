Hello!

The aim of this project is to scrap Coursera.com website, Specifically the data science 
field.

I want to get all the courses names in the data science field and their corresponding
required skills and level of difficulty

I will used the acquired data in the future to build a machine learning model that
recommends to the user the relevant courses based on his skills and the level of difficulty
he/she wants.

I used Selenium to get the data from Coursera.com and saved it into MongoDB.

There are 2 versions of the code (One that uses MongoDB and the other not); 
And in each version there are two files .ipynb & .py (Same file but different extensions)
